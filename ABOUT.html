<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p> 
I was born and raised in Greece, and I live in New York the last 8 months. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and a Master’s in Banking. I’m very familiar and interested in learning Computer Softwares about Graphic Designs, Photography and Music Production. I would like to get involved in Web Development and start working in this Field because it’s something very creative and continually evolving. I would also have the opportunity and the ability to combine all the knowledge and the passion I have in design and photography.
